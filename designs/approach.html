                            <p>In order to plan out our system's design efficiently, we followed a system's engineering design approach which comprised of three parts - a System Design, an Architecture design and a Module design.</p>
                            <p>First presented by our tutor, we decided to follow this approach to better understand the structure and requirements of our system from the earliest of stages up until the very end.</p>
                            
                            <h6>Concept of operations (Con-Ops)</h6>
                            <p>The first step towards this approach was the creation of our Con-Ops - a document outlining our system's characteristics and usages. They allowed us to think carefully about the project's requirements, limitations and usages.</p>
                            <ul class="list-group">
                                <li class="list-group-item"><a href="ConOps.pdf" target="_blank">Our Con-Ops</a></li>
                            </ul>


                            <h6>System Design</h6>
                            <p>This step involved mapping out our project's components - both hardware and software - on a very basic level. No technical details or specific kind of component was needed here.</p>
                            <p>During this stage, we agreed that we needed the following components - a measurement device, a processor, some storage, a power supply, a case for our processor and a means of communication between components.</p>
                            
                            <ul class="list-group">
                                <li class="list-group-item"><a href="SystemDesign.pdf" target="_blank">Our System Design stage</a></li>
                            </ul>

                            <h6>Architecture Design</h6>
                            <p>This stage served as a High Level Design stage - where architectural specifications are understood and several technical approaches are considered for each component. We broke down our System Design in this stage to explore what kind of component we would use exactly - for example, an ultrasonic sensor vs. a laser and InfluxDB over some other database.</p>
                            <p>In this stage we also determined communication between our components and the outside world - LoRaWan.</p>

                                <li class="list-group-item"><a href="ArchitectureDesign.pdf" target="_blank">Our Architecture Design stage</a></li>
                            </ul>
                            <ul class="list-group">
                                <li class="list-group-item"><a href="Backenddesign.pdf" target="_blank">Our Back-end Design</a></li>
                            </ul>

                            <h6>Module Design</h6>
                            <p>This stage served as a Low Level Design stage - where the detailed internal designs for each component is specified. For this stage we have provided pseudo code and test cases of the system's main functions to ensure it is working as expected.</p>
