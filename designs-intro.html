                            <p>In order to plan out our system's design efficiently, we followed a software engineering design approach which comprised of three parts - a system design, an architecture design and a module design.</p>
                            <p>First presented by our tutor, we decided to follow the approach to better understand the structure and requirements of our system from the earliest of stages up until the very end.</p>

                            <h6>System Design</h6>
                            <p>This step involved mapping out our project's components - both hardware and software - but on a very basic level. No technical details or specific kind of component was needed here.</p>
                            <p>During this stage, we agreed we needed the following components - a measurement device, a processor, some storage, a power supply, a case for our processor and a means of communication between components.</p>

                            <h6>Architecture Design</h6>
                            <p>This stage served as a High Level Design stage - where architectural specifications are understood and several technical approaches are considered for each component. We broke down our System Design in this stage to explore what kind of component we would use exactly - for example, an ultrasonic sensor vs. a laser and InfluxDB over some other database.</p>
                            <p>In this stage we also determined communication between our components and the outside world - LoRaWan.</p>

                            <h6>Module Design</h6>
                            <p>This stage served as a Low Level Design stage - where the detailed internal designs for each component is specified. Thus, we spent the major part of this stage coding our system, creating different classes to work with i.e. an engineering menu class and how it would interact with other classes.</p>
                            <p>During this stage we started working with a battery, and coded out the functionality needed for our processor to gain supply from it.</p>
