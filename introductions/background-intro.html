                            <p>In this introduction, you will learn about our project and how and why we came to choose it above others.</p>

                            <p>Our project is called Flood Watch - and will be used to detect, record and display river levels in Canterbury in order to predict potential floodings and mitigate their effects.</p>

                            <p>Going back to when we started on the drawing board, we initially had four ideas surrounding the topic we had chosen - 'Lego Smart City'. We started to think of ways in which IoT could be introduced in cities to help prevent things like natural disasters or recent terror attacks. We came up with the following:</p>

                                    <strong>Pavement barriers when cars get too close to them</strong>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li class="blue">Sensors along a road parallel to the pavement, as soon as the car hits the sensor, panels slide up from underground (or similar)</li>

                            <p>Out of all five ideas, we happened to like the water level monitoring and pavement barriers ideas best. By process of elimination however, we started pointing out potential flaws with each idea to help us choose our final one. We found that with the pavement barrier idea, it would be hard for a sensor to differentiate between an unsafe driver wanting to mount the pavement or someone who genuinely hit it by accident. We agreed that it might be slightly risky to take on a project of that grand a scale given we were learning new technologies already (namely embedded programming).</p>
                            <p>We therefore chose the water level monitoring idea as we agreed that it would be more feasible to measure water levels than a count of tyres hitting a pavement. Furthermore, our tutor had previously experienced a project of the sort, and we had knowledge of The Oxford Flood Network project which we could use as guidance and as something to build upon. We thought that although less risky, there was still a lot of research involved and a lot of new technologies to be learnt - enough for us to still feel challenged yet able to understand the requirements.</p>
