                            <p>Our scenarios came about after creating our <a href="ConOps.pdf">Con-Ops</a> (a first basic step outlining the requirements of our system).</p>

                            <p>They really got us into thinking about how our sensor and device would be used, which in turn helped us in deciding further requirements of the system as a whole in the design stages. For example the fact that we would need to deploy our sensor at a location containing a bridge or some sort of support near the river.</p>

                            <p>In Scenario 1, we imagine that our sensor is deployed somewhere near a river, and we explain how exactly the deployment is done for the first time. We also explain the initial testing procedure given the first deployment.</p>

                            <p>In Scenario 2, we imagine the behaviour needed to confirm that the device is working and sending readings on its own.</p>
