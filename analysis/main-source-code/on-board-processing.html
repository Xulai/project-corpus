                            <p>For processing the river measurements that were taken by our device, we decided to change how the device operates in differing situations to either reduce measurements sent, or even increase sampling rates. We focused heavily on reducing the amount of readings that needed to be sent as much as possible. We acheived this by ignoring many measurements (or increasing sampling rates) that we deemed redundant for data gathering by using our self constructed concepts such as the following (most are customisable by the user): </p>

                            <h6>Worth Sending Range</h6>
                            <p>If the measurement is within a given range of the last measurement that was sent to The Things Network (TTN), then the measurement will be ignored. It is not helpful to know that the river levels have not changed much at all, so the latest measurement sent is assumed to be the current river level.</p>

                            <h6 style="margin-top: 15px!important;">Ignore Threshold</h6>
                            <p>This is a customisable threshold that can be set depending on the user to ignore any measurements taken that fall below.</p>

                            <h6 style="margin-top: 15px!important;">Accelerated Readings Mode (AR mode)</h6>
                            <p>This concept is for the scenaro that the river is at a concerningly high level. Similar to the ignore threshold, this uses a threshold that triggers "AR Mode" once the river levels are above the customised level to increase how quickly measurements are taken. This is to try and avoid missing crusial updates about river levels rising to the point of possible flooding.</p>

                            <h6 style="margin-top: 15px!important;">Still Here</h6>
                            <p>This is used in conjunction with the rest of the concepts used reduce values sent. If values are not sent after a large amount of samples (usually 24 samples), then a "Still Here" message is sent so that we know that the device is still active and opperating correctly.</p>
