                <p>Our graphs acted as a proof of concept at the Project Fair whilst demonstrating our API's functionality. Using JavaScript framework Vue.js, a component for every time period that we might be interested in looking at was created. Each component (named DailyReadings, MonthlyReadings etc) is selectable via some buttons and include a function that runs a GET request on our API's <code>device</code> endpoints to fetch the ID of each device. Then, a further request is sent to an endpoint that includes the device's ID, the time period and the data required (readings). For each response received, the component creates a graph displaying readings taken by that device. A request to fetch daily readings for device "abc1" would look like this: <code>device/abc1/reading/daily?type='1'</code>. Type 1 in this case refers to readings only.</p>
                <p>We chose to use Vue.js due to its popularity and efficientness when building user interfaces. As we wanted a quick and smooth user experience, it's component based structure matched well with the web page that we wanted to create and it's documentation was easy to read and learn.</p>
